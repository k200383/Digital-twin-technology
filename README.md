# Digital-twin-technology

Research-and-development based project. Created a Digital Twin model of our university basement using 3D modelling tools such as Sketchup and Blender, then deployed it on Microsoft Azure using Azure Digital Twins. The Digital Twin instances were developed using DTDL JSON files, by splitting the basement model into five models: Building Facade, Lobby, Passageway, Office, Computer Lab. The JSON files were uploaded on Microsoft Azure as Digital Twin instances and links were created between the Digital Twin 3D model and the Digital Twin instances. The frontend was created using HTML Pug, and the aim of the application was to tell the user whether their proposed construction was feasible or not.

For the research part of our project, we wrote a research paper involving a literature review of 16 recent research papers on Digital Twins, along with an analysis of the extent to which we were able to implement the Digital Twin and the challenges associated with it.
